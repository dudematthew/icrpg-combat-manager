# ICRPG Combat Manager - TODO & Feedback

## Feedback from ICRPG Creator

> Pretty slick overall. It immediately feels like an ICRPG tool.
> 
> There is a lot going on, which makes it hard to see how this would play out at the table in real time, but each of the individual tools have some good bones to them and I'm excited to see where each of them end up.

### Specific Notes:

#### Timers and Battlefield
- **Timers and Battlefield feel like they would see the heaviest use, those would be good to have at the top for easy access**

#### Monster Creation
- **Having the tiers there makes it really nice for Quickly adding a monster, but it would be nice to have more control on individual pieces of the monster. You've hidden additional controls in the edit screen after the monster has been added. Those would be nice to surface more. Need both paths.**
> Add a settings modal for the whole app, with a toggle for "advanced mode" that would show the advanced controls for the monster creation form. We could also add a more visible edit button for the monster cards.

#### Timer Improvements
- **Timers would be a great tool to have on the phone and like that it has options for Rounds and Turns. I wish the randomize was attached to the duration and not the name. Also really cool to see the timer connected to the Battlefield Next Turn/Round buttons**
> Add a randomize button to the duration field.

#### Battlefield Enhancements
- **Battlefield feels like the king piece for the tool, but feels a little disjointed. Really like the conditions and the damage buttons, but wish the bonus and action details were more prominent. You'd probably also need a way to add health back in. It could also be nice to have some sort of indicator that they monster has taken their turn this round. Also there is a lot of scrolling if you have more than a few monsters**
> Add a health restoration button to the monster cards.
> Add a button that checks the monster as done turn.
> Create some sort of a way that makes the monster not take so much space while still giving the user the ability to see the monster's details.
> Make the monster bonus and action details more prominent (stand out more), maybe with a big colored +X.

#### Combat Mechanics
- **Combat Mechanics feels like it should be named Target, but love the buttons and the calculations there. Really like the result readout except I have no idea what it means between True Random and Psuedo Random.**
> Make the true random default with a warning if fetch fails explaining that it's a fallback.
> Add info about what's the difference between true and pseudo random.
> Rename "Combat Mechanics" to "Target".
> Create a more clear info about what happened on critical hit.

#### Additional Thoughts
- Make the app more desktop friendly by moving different sections to the screen sides.

### Overall Assessment
> All in all, excellent work. I think there is a lot going for it, and if you refine that experience for seamless mobile play, I think you've got a winner 🔥
